        <h3 class="block-title">Cumbersome</h3>
        <p>
          While wearing this armor, you have disadvantage on Dexterity checks.
        </p>

        <h3 class="block-title">Damage Reduction (DR)</h3>
        <p>
          Each armor type has its own Damage Reduction value, representing the
          equipmentâ€™s ability to mitigate damage received. This value is only
          increased either via the armor receiving a magical +1 (or higher)
          bonus, or when an ability or magical item explicitly says it does so.
        </p>

        <h3 class="block-title">Lightweight</h3>
        <p>
          You can wear this armor without having the necessary armor
          proficiency, provided your biology allows. Constitution checks made to
          maintain concentration while wearing lightweight armor you are not
          proficient with are made with disadvantage.
        </p>

        <h3 class="block-title">Maximum Dexterity</h3>
        <p>
          The heavier the armor, the more it restricts how much of your
          Dexterity modifier you can use to increase your AC. When calculating
          your AC (10 + your Dexterity modifier), the bonus from your Dexterity
          modifier cannot exceed this maximum. This only affects your AC, not
          any other uses for your Dexterity modifier.
        </p>

        <h3 class="block-title">Strength Requirement</h3>
        <p>
          Some heavy armor requires a minimum Strength score to be used
          properly. If your Strength score is less than this total, your
          movement speed is reduced by 10 feet.
