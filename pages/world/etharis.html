                <strong>Etharis</strong> is the fractured core of Vandross —
                once a beacon of divine order, now a patchwork of kingdoms
                rotting beneath the weight of their own sins. The gods are
                silent, the noble houses bleed each other dry, and monsters walk
                openly beneath a sun that seems to grow dimmer each year.

            <h2 class="block-title">A Continent Unraveling</h2>
            <p>
              From the icy coasts of Valika to the haunted ruins of Ostenwald,
              every corner of Etharis bears the mark of tragedy. Its people
              endure through grim pragmatism, black faith, and desperate hope —
              for none can remember a time when the dead stayed buried.
            </p>
            <h2 class="block-title">Regions of Etharis</h2>
            <p>
              Etharis is an expansive continent occupied by empires and ancient
              kingdoms. Cultures are diverse and deep rooted. Each nation has
              been shaped by its people, history, power groups, relationship
              with magic, cataclysmic events, and neighboring sovereigns.
            </p>
            <p>
              No realm is singular in its culture or values. Each represents a
              different genre of dark fantasy and horror, and therefore,
              different themes are best explored there. A single region could
              accommodate an entire campaign, or you can experience them all
              through your adventures by traveling across the continent.
            </p>
            <p>
              The history, culture, and themes of each region are explored
              deeply in this book. Below, small snapshots of these realms are
              provided. There is no correct order to experience them, except
              that you should start wherever your inspiration takes you.
            </p>

                <a
                  href="../world/regions/burach_empire.html"
                  class="block-title"
                  >The Burach Empire</a
                >
              </h3>
              <p>
                Once a beacon of civilization that extended its territory into
                every realm, the Bürach Empire crumbles and rots, now clinging
                to its heartland provinces like an old lion ravaged by a
                lifetime of wounds and illness. Though still formidable in
                wealth and might, those within the empire live each day sensing
                that the end is approaching.
              </p>
              
              <h3>
                <a href="../world/regions/ostoya.html" class="block-title"
                  >Ostoya</a
                >
              </h3>
              <p>
                Ostoya is a sunless realm of shadows and blood. The hearts of the folk who live in the Ostoyan Empire are as hard and cold as the land they live upon, forced to toil beneath a black sky and a callous nobility that wants to drain everything from its peasantry, including its blood.
              </p>

              <h3>
                <a href="../world/regions/charneault.html" class="block-title"
                  >The Charneault Kingdom</a
                >
              </h3>
              <p>
                The Charneault Kingdom is a realm of beauty that far exceeds any other. Hidden behind the mystical forest of the Grove Maze is a land of rolling emerald hills, mist-veiled glens, and countless flowing rivers. Charneault is patrolled by knights of virtue. A deep connection to nature has been entwined into Charnelaise culture from the elves who first settled these idyllic lands.
              </p>

              <h3>
                <a
                  href="../world/regions/castinellan-provinces.html"

                  >The Castinellan Provinces</a
                >
              </h3>
              <p>
                Faith unifies the Castinellan Provinces. Fervently devoted to the edicts of the Arch Seraphs, the people of Castinella recognize the evils that can be performed through acts of arcane magic—and they do everything in their power to stop those acts from happening. If a few innocent or good-hearted people are killed or tortured in the process, it is considered a small price to pay in the name of safety.
              </p>

              <h3>
                <a href="../world/regions/valika.html" class="block-title"
                  >Valika</a
                >
              </h3>
              <p>
                Far to the north, at the frozen edge of the continent, lies the homeland of the Valikan Clans. Each day, the hardy folk who dwell in Valika must endure the unforgiving environment, rampaging elementals, and the blood-fueled conflicts that erupt between the various clans.
              </p>

              <h3>
                <a href="../world/regions/liesech.html" class="block-title"
                  >Liesech</a
                >
              </h3>
              <p>
                Liesech is the putrid cauldron of disease where the Weeping Pox originated. Its people attempt to carry on their mercantile ways of life as their friends, family, peers, and even enemies die from the dreaded disease. Although the disease has a supernatural cause, its effects are nonetheless clear to see. Body horror and the corruption involved in that genre come not just through the disease itself, but from the sometimes questionable actions of those who attempt to cure it.
              </p>

              <h3>
                <a href="../world/regions/morencia.html" class="block-title"
                  >Morencia</a
                >
              </h3>
              <p>
                Morencia’s disease is social rather than medical. The greedy and conniving residents of this center of banking and commerce smile and extend one hand while the other clutches a poisoned dagger. The vibrant and effusive façade of Morencia hides dark secrets and secret cults that would do anything for an ounce of power and one more gold coin.
