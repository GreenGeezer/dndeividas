          The sun never rises on the Ostoyan Empire. Ruled by an aristocracy of
          vampires and their servants, the Crimson Court governs the nation with
          their greedy claws, sharp eyes, and sharper fangs. Located to the east
          of the Grey Spine, Ostoya was founded centuries ago by Bürach
          secessionists—migrants who fled the Bürach Empire’s authoritarian rule
          and the edicts of the Hearthkeepers. Ostoya was a new land anyone
          could call their own. Though in recent times, it has become a place as
          fractured and overwhelmed with monsters as their Bürach cousins across
          the western mountains. Of its six provinces, Raevo has split from the
          Ostoyan Empire. It currently engages in a civil war to uphold that
          spirit of freedom which founded Ostoya. Raevo aims to push beyond its
          current borders to liberate other provinces from the blood-drenched
          grip of the Crimson Court. Even within the provinces loyal to the
          Crimson Court, power is elusive. The members of the Court must remain
          vigilant to quell any further rebellion within their own regions of
          sovereignty. More importantly, they must keep an eye on each other.
          The machinations of the nobility run deep and seem to be as sustaining
          as the blood they drink. For average citizens, life in Ostoya is dark
          and often terrifying. Peasants work the land, which is loaned to them
          by deathless masters, and pay crushing tithes on any modicum of wealth
          they might collect. But what the nobility ask for in return for social
          order and protection is far costlier than any coins. All who are ruled
          by the Crimson Court fear the blood tax. There’s a particularly morbid
          Ostoyan peasant saying: “Only in death will your toils end.” But even
          that’s not true. After all, many of the dead in Ostoya are forced to
          toil further upon the bloody strings of their vampiric masters.
