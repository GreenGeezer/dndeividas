            Castalore is the heart of Raevo—a fortress-city spiraling upward
            along a cliff face, designed for defense above all else. Governed by
            the Council of Mages, led by
            <a href="../characters/mina-taliesin.html" class="highlight-text"
              >Mina Taliesin, the Lady of Masks</a
            >, the city has never fallen to either Bürach or the Crimson Court.

        <h2 class="block-title">The Magocratic Republic</h2>
        <p>
          Since Raevo's secession, Castalore has become the seat of a magocratic
          republic—the only functioning democracy in Ostoya. Internal political
          tension persists between pragmatic magocrats, the Order of Dawn, and
          religious or druidic factions.
        </p>

        <h2 class="block-title">More Information Coming Soon</h2>
        <p>
          Detailed information about Castalore's districts, the Council of
          Mages, notable locations, defenses, and current political tensions
          will be added here as the campaign develops.
