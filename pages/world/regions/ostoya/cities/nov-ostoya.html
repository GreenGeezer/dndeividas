            Nov Ostoya is the capital of the Ostoyan Empire and seat of the
            Crimson Court. Ruled by
            <a href="../characters/drago-koshevek.html" class="highlight-text"
              >Grand Duke Drago Koshevek</a
            >, the city is starkly divided between the desperate Low Streets and
            the elite Crimson Heights. Beneath it all lies the
            Necropolis—partially sealed, perpetually restless, and the source of
            the Darkfall that changed everything.

        <h2 class="block-title">The Darkfall</h2>
        <p>
          The catastrophic event known as the Darkfall began here when seismic
          collapse revealed an ancient necropolis beneath the city. From this
          breach emerged vast undead forces, the sun ceased to rise over Ostoya,
          and the Crimson Court rose to power in the chaos that followed.
        </p>

        <h2 class="block-title">More Information Coming Soon</h2>
        <p>
          Detailed information about Nov Ostoya's districts (Low Streets,
          Crimson Heights), the Necropolis, notable locations, factions, and
          current affairs will be added here as the campaign develops.
