          <p>
            Soma is the political and economic core of the Ostoyan Empire.
            Fertile plains, coastal access, and trade dominance converge here.
            At its center stands
            <a href="cities/nov-ostoya.html" class="highlight-text"
              >Nov Ostoya</a
            >, capital of the empire and seat of the Crimson Court.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2 class="block-title">Nov Ostoya - The Capital</h2>
        <p>
          <a href="cities/nov-ostoya.html" class="highlight-text">Nov Ostoya</a>
          is divided starkly between districts. The Low Streets are plagued by
          crime, addiction, and desperation, while the Crimson Heights house
          vampiric elites and collaborators. Beneath the city lies the
          Necropolis—partially sealed, perpetually restless.
        </p>

        <h2 class="block-title">The Darkfall's Legacy</h2>
        <p>
          Fissures from the Darkfall remain active throughout Soma. Undead
          incursions are frequent, and the populace lives under constant
          military oversight. Fear of monsters competes with fear of authority;
          often, the distinction is unclear.
        </p>

        <h2 class="block-title">The Necropolis</h2>
        <p>
          Beneath Nov Ostoya lies the ancient Necropolis—the source of the
          Darkfall. Though partially sealed by the Crimson Court, it remains
          active, spawning undead and leaking necromantic energy into the city
          above. What secrets and horrors remain buried in its depths are known
          only to the Court.
        </p>
