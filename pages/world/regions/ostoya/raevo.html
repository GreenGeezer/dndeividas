            Raevo occupies the northern reaches of Ostoya and has long been
            culturally distinct from the rest of the empire. Founded around
            prophetic visions and fortified against encroachment, the province
            has historically resisted both external conquest and internal
            authoritarianism. Since its secession, Raevo has reorganized into a
            magocratic republic—a beacon of resistance against the Crimson
            Court.

        <h2 class="block-title">The Secession</h2>
        <p>
          Since its secession, Raevo has reorganized into a magocratic republic.
          Magical research unrestricted elsewhere in Etharis has become its
          primary defense against the Crimson Court. This has made Raevo both a
          beacon of resistance and a destabilizing influence within Ostoya.
        </p>

        <h2 class="block-title">Life in Raevo</h2>
        <p>
          Life in Raevo is harsh. Crop yields suffer under eternal dusk,
          necromantic energies prevent peaceful burial of the dead, and Valikan
          raids from the north devastate smaller settlements. Despite this,
          popular sentiment remains strongly anti-vampiric, and collaboration
          with the Court is widely regarded as treason.
        </p>

        <h2 class="block-title">Major Settlements</h2>

        <h3 class="highlight-text">
          <a href="cities/castalore.html">Castalore</a>
        </h3>
        <p>
          <a href="cities/castalore.html" class="highlight-text">Castalore</a>
          stands as the province's heart: a fortress-city spiraling upward along
          a cliff face, designed for defense above all else. Governed by a
          Council of Mages, the city has never fallen to either Bürach or the
          Crimson Court. Internal political tension persists between pragmatic
          magocrats, the Order of Dawn, and religious or druidic factions.
