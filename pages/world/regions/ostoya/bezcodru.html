            Bezcodru begins and ends at the Stillborn Forest. Rich in timber and
            ore, the province is strategically invaluable despite its hostility.
            Rivers, mountains, and forest routes allow the export of resources
            essential to maintaining the empire's infrastructure and defenses.

        <h2 class="block-title">The Stillborn Forest</h2>
        <p>
          Life in Bezcodru is defined by vigilance. The forest canopy blocks
          even moonlight, and monstrous threats are constant. Residents are
          blunt, withdrawn, and rarely leave their homes unless necessary.
          Safety is communal and enforced through habit rather than trust.

        <p>
          <a href="cities/lunsk.html" class="highlight-text">Lunsk</a>, the
          province's primary settlement, sits on the Glasswater Lake. Though a
          port town, it lacks typical commercial energy. Firelight is dimmed,
          patrols are silent, and every structure is oriented defensively toward
          the forest.
