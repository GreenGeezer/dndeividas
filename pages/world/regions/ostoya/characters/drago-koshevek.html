            <strong>Grand Duke Drago Koshevek</strong> is a Soman vampire and
            the supreme ruler of the Crimson Court. Ancient, calculating, and
            openly feared even among his peers, he oversees all provincial
            appointments and imperial policy across Ostoya. His word is law, and
            his authority is absolute.

        <h2 class="block-title">Role in the Crimson Court</h2>
        <p>
          As the Grand Duke, Koshevek sits at the apex of Ostoyan power. The six
          provincial rulers answer directly to him, and failure to maintain
          control is met with swift and brutal removal. His influence extends
          into every corner of the empire through fear, manipulation, and
          centuries of accumulated leverage.
        </p>

        <h2 class="block-title">More Information Coming Soon</h2>
        <p>
          Detailed information about the Grand Duke's history, abilities, goals,
          relationships with other Court members, and role in the Darkfall will
          be added here as the campaign develops.
