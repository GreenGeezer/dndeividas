          <p>
            Estspine is the oldest province of Ostoya and the birthplace of the
            empire itself. From its river valleys and mountain passes, the first
            migrants spread eastward to escape Büracher rule. Every major
            conflict in Ostoyan history has left its mark here, making Estspine
            as much a symbol as it is a territory.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2 class="block-title">Geography & Environment</h2>
        <p>
          The province exists under constant strain. To the west lies the Bürach
          Empire, ever watchful beyond the Grey Spine. To the north,
          <a href="raevo.html" class="highlight-text">Raevo</a>
          agitates for liberation. To the south, the Crimson Court asserts its
          authority through fear. The people of Estspine are divided—some view
          the Court as necessary defenders, others as usurpers no better than
          the empire they replaced.
        </p>

        <h2 class="block-title">Major Settlements</h2>

        <h3 class="highlight-text">
          <a href="cities/fallowheart.html">Fallowheart</a>

        <p>
          <a href="cities/fallowheart.html" class="highlight-text"
            >Fallowheart</a
          >
          dominates the region both militarily and culturally. Its fortress,
          <a href="cities/kaer-vena.html" class="highlight-text">Kaer Vena</a>,
          has withstood centuries of sieges and now serves as a cornerstone of
          vampiric legitimacy. Control of Fallowheart allows the Crimson Court
          to present itself as the inheritor of Ostoya's original resistance,
          despite widespread dissent.
        </p>

        <h2 class="block-title">Economy & Trade</h2>
        <p>
          Economically, Estspine relies on river trade and its proximity to
          Bürach. Lumber, produce, and ore flow eastward, while daring merchants
          cross the Elian Pass bearing foreign goods—most notably Stehlenwald
          black powder. Trade persists not out of optimism, but necessity.

          rather than earning his station. Widely regarded as weak, unstable,
          and expendable.

          <a href="characters/gavril-boskovic.html" class="highlight-text"
            >Castellan Gavril Bosković</a

        </h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Raevan military commander.</strong> Currently encamped north
          of Fallowheart, fostering internal rebellion while avoiding a full
          siege to prevent Bürach intervention.

        <h2 class="block-title">Themes & Hooks</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Contested Loyalty:</strong> The people of Estspine are
            caught between three powers—Bürach, Raevo, and the Crimson Court.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Historical Legacy:</strong> Every stone in Estspine bears
            the weight of Ostoya's founding ideals and subsequent betrayal.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Border Intrigue:</strong> Smugglers, spies, and refugees
            cross the Grey Spine regularly, bringing opportunity and danger.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Weak Leadership:</strong> Viscount Warlow's instability
            creates opportunities for ambitious characters to seize power or
            influence.
