            Terinima occupies the geographic and economic center of Ostoya.
            Nourished by the Great Arteriyan River, it once sustained vast
            farmland and open pasture. Though the Darkfall crippled traditional
            agriculture, Terinima remains the empire's primary source of food
            through adaptation rather than abundance.

        <h2 class="block-title">The People of Terinima</h2>
        <p>
          The population consists largely of farmers, ranchers, hunters, and
          fishermen. Terinimans are insular, pragmatic, and resistant to
          ideological movements. Their priorities are survival and continuity,
          making the province comparatively easy to govern. Compliance is often
          purchased through selective mercy rather than force.
        </p>

        <h2 class="block-title">Major Settlements</h2>

        <h3 class="highlight-text">
          <a href="cities/crowsbend.html">Crowsbend</a>
        </h3>
        <p>
          Settlements are dispersed and modest, favoring large family-held lands
          over dense urban centers. The notable exception is
          <a href="cities/crowsbend.html" class="highlight-text">Crowsbend</a>,
          a muddy but thriving trade town where goods, rumors, and contraband
          circulate freely. It serves as Ostoya's primary civilian crossroads.
