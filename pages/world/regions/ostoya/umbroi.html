          <p>
            Officially named Umbroi, the Black Mire is a sprawling marshland of
            peat, stagnant water, and decaying vegetation. Travel is treacherous
            even for locals. The environment itself acts as a natural deterrent
            to occupation or reform.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2 class="block-title">Life in the Mire</h2>
        <p>
          Umbroians survive through concealment. Settlements are small, mobile,
          and connected by secret water channels. The value of currency is
          minimal; trade is conducted through necessity—food, tools, and favors.
        </p>

        <h2 class="block-title">The Crimson Court's Reach</h2>
        <p>
          The province's isolation has limited the Crimson Court's direct
          influence. While monsters and spirits abound, the Mire conceals
          dissent as effectively as it conceals its people.
        </p>

        <h2 class="block-title">Major Settlements</h2>

        <h3 class="highlight-text">
          <a href="cities/riven.html">Riven</a>
        </h3>
        <p>
          <a href="cities/riven.html" class="highlight-text">Riven</a>, the
          largest settlement, physically migrates over time as structures sink
          and are rebuilt elsewhere. It serves as the closest thing to a
          permanent center the Mire has to offer.

        <h2 class="block-title">Notable Individuals</h2>

        <h3>

            >Marchioness Iulia Cutov</a
          >
        </h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Nominal ruler of Umbroi.</strong> Commands Ostoya's southern
          fleet and oversees naval security. Publicly marginal; privately
          engaged in covert diplomacy and long-term subversion of the Court.
