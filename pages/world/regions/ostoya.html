              The sun never rises on the Ostoyan Empire. Ruled by an aristocracy
              of vampires and their servants, the
              <strong>Crimson Court</strong> governs the nation with greedy
              claws, sharp eyes, and sharper fangs. What began as a beacon of
              freedom has become a land as dark and oppressive as any it sought
              to escape.

            <h2 class="lore-excerpt-title">On the State and Origins of the Ostoyan Empire</h2>
            <p class="lore-excerpt-author">
              By Dr. Illya Markov, Fellow of Imperial Geography and Historical Studies
            </p>

            <p>
              Ostoya emerged as a secessionist project, founded by migrants
              fleeing the Bürach Empire's rigid imperial authority, religious
              enforcement by the Hearthkeepers, and restrictions on magical
              practice. Early Ostoyan society was decentralized, resource-rich,
              and sustained by trade routes, fertile plains, and shared resistance
              to external rule. For several generations, this independence proved
              viable.
            </p>

            <p>
              Conflict with Bürach was inevitable. Though Ostoya successfully
              repelled repeated invasions through control of the Grey Spine
              passes—most notably at
              <a href="ostoya/cities/fallowheart.html" class="highlight-text"
                >Fallowheart</a
              >—the wars strained the young empire and exposed the limits of its
              unity. These pressures culminated during the second Bürach–Ostoyan
              War, at which point the Darkfall occurred.
            </p>

            <p>
              The <strong>Darkfall</strong> permanently altered Ostoya's political
              and ecological reality. Seismic collapse beneath
              <a href="ostoya/cities/nov-ostoya.html" class="highlight-text"
                >Nov Ostoya</a
              >
              revealed an ancient necropolis, from which vast undead forces
              emerged. The sun ceased to rise over the land, agriculture faltered,
              and monstrous fauna proliferated. Imperial leadership responded with
              containment measures that sealed the necropolis—along with their own
              soldiers—beneath the capital.
            </p>

            <p>
              Among those forces was
              <a href="ostoya/characters/morgen-hund.html" class="highlight-text"
                >Morgen Hund</a
              >, a celebrated Ostoyan commander. His subsequent transformation and
              re-emergence as
              <a href="ostoya/characters/klaus-vorgen.html" class="highlight-text"
                >Klaus Vorgen the Betrayed</a
              >
              marked a decisive shift in Ostoyan governance. With the aid of newly
              freed vampires, Hund eradicated Büracher military presence and
              restructured the state under vampiric rule.
            </p>

            <p>
              The resulting regime, now known as the
              <strong>Crimson Court</strong>, consists of seven immortal nobles
              who exercise absolute authority over Ostoya's provinces. While their
              rule has ensured territorial sovereignty and internal stability, it
              has done so through extreme extraction of labor, wealth, and blood
              from the populace. Peasantry exists in perpetual debt, death does
              not guarantee release from service, and dissent is met with
              immediate suppression.
            </p>

            <p>
              The ongoing secession of
              <a href="ostoya/raevo.html" class="highlight-text">Raevo</a>
              demonstrates that Ostoya's founding ideals persist in limited form.
              However, it also underscores a prevailing academic conclusion:
              Ostoya's liberation from Bürach resulted not in self-rule, but in
              the replacement of an external empire with an internal, immortal
              aristocracy whose interests are fundamentally divorced from those
              they govern.

            <h2 class="lore-excerpt-title">The Provinces of Ostoya</h2>
            <p class="lore-excerpt-author">
              Compiled by Dr. Illya Markov, Fellow of Imperial Geography and Historical Studies
            </p>

            <p>
              Ostoya is divided into six provinces. Each is governed by a lesser
              member of the Crimson Court, operating with near-total autonomy
              under the authority of the
              <a
                href="ostoya/characters/drago-koshevek.html"
                class="highlight-text"
                >Grand Duke</a
              >. Provincial rulership is considered both a privilege and a test.
              Failure to maintain control is interpreted as weakness—an invitation
              for removal from the Court, and often from existence.
            </p>
          </div>

          <!-- ===== Provinces List ===== -->
          <div class="regions-list">
            <h3>
              <a href="ostoya/estspine.html" class="block-title">Estspine</a>
            </h3>
            <p>
              The oldest province of Ostoya and birthplace of the empire itself.
              Estspine is a land of historical significance and present-day
              tension, caught between the Bürach Empire to the west, rebellious
              Raevo to the north, and the Crimson Court to the south. Its
              fortress-city of
              <a href="ostoya/cities/fallowheart.html" class="highlight-text"
                >Fallowheart</a
              >
              stands as both symbol and cornerstone of vampiric legitimacy.
            </p>

            <h3>
              <a href="ostoya/raevo.html" class="block-title">Raevo</a>
            </h3>
            <p>
              The northern province that has seceded from the Ostoyan Empire and
              reorganized as a magocratic republic. Led by the
              <a href="ostoya/cities/castalore.html" class="highlight-text"
                >Council of Mages in Castalore</a
              >, Raevo represents the last bastion of resistance against the
              Crimson Court. Life is harsh beneath eternal dusk, but the spirit
              of independence burns bright.
            </p>

            <h3>
              <a href="ostoya/terinima.html" class="block-title">Terinima</a>
            </h3>
            <p>
              The geographic and economic center of Ostoya, sustained by the
              Great Arteriyan River. Though the Darkfall crippled traditional
              agriculture, Terinima remains the empire's primary source of food
              through grim adaptation. Its people are pragmatic survivors, and
              <a href="ostoya/cities/crowsbend.html" class="highlight-text"
                >Crowsbend</a
              >
              serves as the empire's primary civilian crossroads.
            </p>

            <h3>
              <a href="ostoya/bezcodru.html" class="block-title">Bezcodru</a>
            </h3>
            <p>
              A province defined by the hostile Stillborn Forest. Rich in timber
              and ore, Bezcodru is strategically invaluable despite its dangers.
              The forest blocks even moonlight, and monstrous threats are
              constant. The settlement of
              <a href="ostoya/cities/lunsk.html" class="highlight-text"
                >Lunsk</a
              >
              sits grimly on Glasswater Lake, ever vigilant against the
              darkness.
            </p>

            <h3>
              <a href="ostoya/umbroi.html" class="block-title"
                >Umbroi (The Black Mire)</a
              >
            </h3>
            <p>
              A sprawling marshland of peat, stagnant water, and decay. Travel
              is treacherous, and the environment itself deters occupation. The
              Umbroians survive through concealment, their settlements mobile
              and connected by secret channels. Even the Crimson Court's
              influence is limited here, where the mire conceals both dissent
              and its people.
            </p>

            <h3>
              <a href="ostoya/soma.html" class="block-title">Soma</a>
            </h3>
            <p>
              The political and economic core of the Ostoyan Empire, home to
              <a href="ostoya/cities/nov-ostoya.html" class="highlight-text"
                >Nov Ostoya</a
              >, capital and seat of the Crimson Court. The city is starkly
              divided between the desperate Low Streets and the elite Crimson
              Heights. Beneath it all lies the Necropolis—partially sealed,
              perpetually restless, and the source of the Darkfall that changed
              everything.
