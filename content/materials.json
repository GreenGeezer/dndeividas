    "description": "--- title: Adamantine ---  Adamantine’s secretive forging techniques are jealously guarded by the dwarves of the Bürach Empire, specifically in the dwarven thanedom of Rauland. The capital city of Sthelenwald stands amid the jagged mountains, its forges lit by glowing runes and watched over by stern dwarven overseers. Only those who earn the trust of these dwarven lords—through great deeds or impressive wealth—can gain access to raw adamant or have an item forged from it.  Adamantine is formed by blending adamant (mined from rare adamantite ores deep in asteroids or volcanic fissures) with silver and electrum. It is black with a green sheen in candlelight and impossibly hard. Dwarven master-smiths know how to temper brittleness into durability, creating armor and weapons that resist critical blows and cleave through hardened barriers. To learn its secret is to risk dwarven ire and imperial scrutiny.",

While nominally independent, Chult’s resources—especially the abundance of monstrous shells, chitin, and hides—are coveted by surrounding nations. Expeditions from mercantile princes, adventurer companies, and imperial armies all vie for these raw materials, hoping to return home with enough monster carapace to craft exceptional armor.  Carapace armor is lighter than steel and can grant remarkable agility. Druids, frontier warriors, and tribal champions often wear it, drawn from creatures with immense natural DR. The process of harvesting and treating the shell is part of local Chultan tradition, involving complex rituals and dances meant to appease the beast’s lingering spirit.",

The Arcanist Inquisition and Sanctioned Witch Hunters, both influential factions in Toletum, arm themselves with darksteel gear to suppress enemy spellcasters. Anyone wishing to buy or sell darksteel faces oppressive scrutiny from the Inquisition, ensuring Toletum’s monopoly.  Darksteel disrupts magical energies, making it invaluable for capturing or combating spellcasters. It’s dark brown with a subtle sheen. Rumors say that some secret dwarven halls and hidden gnome workshops also know how to shape it, but the Inquisition’s spies ensure such knowledge seldom spreads.",

Operating throughout Etharis, they often haunt the borders of the Bürach Empire and Ostoyan frontiers, returning from their crusades with demon corpses. They craft demonhide armor to channel the demons’ regenerative properties against their enemies—though at a terrible cost to their own bodies and souls.  Demonhide fuses with the wearer’s flesh. Its leathery texture and faint infernal runes reflect the tormented essence bound within. Warriors who don it rarely do so lightly, as the corruption it may spread can be nearly as dangerous as the foes it helps them overcome.",
    "armor_effect": "Demonhide infuses with the wearers flesh, binding the hard leathery hide with the skin. Due to this magical symbiotic relationship, you can as an Action spend 1 hit-die and for one minute gain CON + 1 temporary hit-points per turn, provided that you have at least 1 hit point, as the Armor forcibly melds your flesh back together. After the effect ends you need to make a DC 10 CON saving throw. On a failure, you suffer one point of exhaustion.  Removing the Armor cost half of your health.

The secret of crafting dragonhide or dragonbone equipment is hoarded by The Green Blades, a secretive dragon-hunting society that operates in the shadows. Rumor places their hidden forges in the wilderness of the Charneault Kingdom or the broken borders of the Bale Route, where they engage in whispered trade with desperate hunters and The Red Hand assassins.  Dragonhide retains elemental resistances and can even harness draconic power. Crafters must carefully flense and tan the hide, praying the dragon’s lingering malice doesn’t curse the finished piece. Green Blades artisans are paid handsomely to outfit hunters, kings, or foolhardy adventurers daring to face a wyrm.",
    "armor_effect": "You wear the scales, hide and bones of one Dragon. While wearing this Armor you have advantage on saving throws against the Frightful Presence and breath weapons from the Dragons that are the same type as your Armor, and you have resistance to one damage type determined by the kind of dragon that provided the scales.  Furthermore, once a day, the you can use the armor to awaken the dragon spirit inside and gain immunity to the damage type for one minute.",

There is an additional cost of 4,000 gp for heavy armor, 2,500 gp for medium armor, and 1,500 for light armor. This additional cost is reduced by 50% if you possess the body of a slain creature whose hide is mostly undamaged and sufficient for armor of this type, and by another 25% if you are able to skin the creature yourself with a DC 20 Wisdom (Survival) check. If you fail the check by 5 or more, the hide is ruined and cannot be made into armor. For a creature’s hide to be appropriate for a suit of armor, the creature must be of challenge rating 6 or greater.",
    "weapon_effect": "As part of an attack, you can unleash an attack that mimics the breath weapon of the dragon whose scales adorn your weapon. This attack takes the form of a 15-foot cone, within which creatures must make a Dexterity saving throw against a DC equal to 10 + your proficiency bonus modifier. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d6 damage of the type associated with the dragon's breath weapon, or half as much damage on a successful save. You may use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and all expended uses are restored after a long rest.",

Strange crystals and shards of otherworldly matter litter the ruinous streets. Desperate artisans and psionic savants learned to shape these shards into Ilithon armor. Today, wandering merchants or daring scavengers poke through the irradiated rubble of Drakenheim to find the raw psychic materials needed.  Ilithon armor protects the mind, repelling psionic assaults and obscuring telepathic detection. Owning a suit marks you as someone who has ventured too close to Drakenheim’s madness, or who has trafficked with the psionically gifted outcasts eking a living in its devastated outskirts.",

Ironbark forging is a sacred art; foreigners rarely earn the right to learn, let alone purchase Ironbark equipment.  Ironbark is grown from ancient, enchanted trees.

A suit of krakenhide armor signals one’s status as a legend of the icy seas.  Krakenhide preserves the monstrous strength and elemental fury of the deep.
