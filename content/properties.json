  "Ammunition": "You can use a weapon that has the Ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. The type of ammunition required is specified with the weapon's range. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon).",
  "Armor-Piercing": "An Armor-Piercing weapon is a Melee weapon designed to punch through armor or thick hide. When you make an attack roll using an Armor-Piercing weapon, you gain a +1 bonus to the attack roll if your target is wearing armor or has an Armor Class of 18 or higher.",
  "Blackpowder": "Blackpowder weapons fire projectiles with ear-splitting noise, shredding armor with deadly force. When fired, Blackpowder weapons emit a deafening crack audible 300 feet away. A Blackpowder weapon exposed to heavy rain, submerged, or similarly drenched in water, can't fire until dried for 1 hour. These weapons use paper cartridge bullets as ammunition.",
  "Cumbersome": "Cumbersome weapons are difficult to wield but are effective ranged tools for those strong enough to wield them. When making an attack with a Cumbersome weapon, you must use your Strength modifier for the attack and damage rolls.",
  "Damage": "A Damage property weapon can deal different types of damage. When you hit with an attack from this weapon, choose one of the damage types allowed.",

  "Hafted": "A Hafted weapon's haft can function well as an off-hand attack. After you use the Attack action to attack with a Hafted weapon, you can use a Bonus Action to make a melee attack with the haft. The haft deals 1d6 Bludgeoning damage, and you add your ability modifier to damage.",
  "Heavy": "You have Disadvantage on attack rolls with a Heavy weapon if it's a melee weapon and your Strength score isn't at least 13 or if it's a ranged weapon and your Dexterity score isn't at least 13.",

That extra attack must be made with a different Light weapon, and you don't add your ability modifier to the extra attack's damage unless that modifier is negative. For example, you can attack with a Shortsword in one hand and a Dagger in the other using the Attack action and a Bonus Action, but you don't add your Strength or Dexterity modifier to the damage roll of the Bonus Action unless that modifier is negative.",
  "Loading": "You can fire only one piece of ammunition from a Loading weapon when you use an action, a Bonus Action, or a Reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.",
  "Magazine": "A weapon with the Magazine property also has a number and an ammunition type. The weapon holds that amount and type of ammunition, which you can expend before needing to reload the weapon. As a Bonus Action, you may remove a Magazine and then reload it with a new Magazine. A Magazine weapon comes with two empty magazines included in the weapon's cost and weight. An additional empty magazine for a Magazine weapon costs 25 GP. Loading an empty Magazine with ammunition takes 1 minute.",

  "Reach": "A Reach weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for Opportunity Attacks with it.",
  "Repeater": "Repeater weapons can fire ammo in quick succession, using multiple barrels or quick-reloading mechanisms. When you take the Attack action with a Repeater weapon, you can shoot multiple times if you have features that let you attack more than once as part of that action, such as Extra Attack. After taking the Attack action you can use a Bonus Action to attack once with the same weapon. You don't add your ability modifier to the Bonus Action's attack, unless that modifier is negative.",
  "Thrown": "If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack, and you can draw that weapon as part of the attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for the attack and damage rolls that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon.",
